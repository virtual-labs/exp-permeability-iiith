			"question": "2. For clay soils, soils with greater void ratios have ____ permeability.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Lesser",
				"b": "More",
				"c": "Equal",
				"d": "Zero"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "In general, permeability increases with void ratio. But it is not applicable to all types of soils. For example, clay has a higher void ratio than any other types of soil but permeability for clays is very low. This is because the flow path through voids in case of clays is extremely small such that water cannot flow through this path easily.",
				"b": "In general, permeability increases with void ratio. But it is not applicable to all types of soils. For example, clay has a higher void ratio than any other types of soil but permeability for clays is very low.",
				"c": "There is a direct correlation between void ratio and permability and hence this cannot be the answer.",
				"d": "This is nearly impossible to achieve."
