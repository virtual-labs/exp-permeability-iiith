 Permeability is defined as the property of porous material which permits the passage or seepage of water through its interconnected voids. The coefficient of permeability is finding out following method.

a) Laboratory method:
i. Variable head test.
ii. Constant head test.

b) Field method:
i. Pumping out test.
ii. Pumping in test.

c) Indirect test:
i. Computation from grain size or specific surface.
ii. Horizontal capillarity test.
iii. Consolidation test data.

The derivation of the coefficient of permeability is based on the assumption of the validity of the Darcy¡¯s law to the flow of water in soil. The term coefficient of permeability implies the velocity of flow of water through the soil under unit hydraulic gradient, and consequently has the same units as that of velocity.
