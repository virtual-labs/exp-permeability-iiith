### Constant Head Test
1. Add a permeameter from the apparatus menu. 
2. Add a soil sample from the apparatus menu. The sample is directly added to the permeameter mould.
3. Add filters from the apparatus menu to the top and bottom of the permeameter. Each of the filters has an attached pipe for inflow/outflow of liquid. 
4. Add a water supply from the apparatus menu to the top filter's pipe. This consists of a filled reservoir and a tap. The tap is to maintain a constant head at the input/reservoir.
5. Add a container from the apparatus menu to collect the outgoing liquid (water). The container has markings to help determine the quantity of water collected.
6. Allow water to flow through the permeameter (and hence the soil) by clicking on the reservoir. Observe the change in the water head's at the two manometers.
7. Click the restart button to perform the experiment again.


### Variable Head Test
1. Add a mould from the apparatus menu. 
2. Add a soil sample from the apparatus menu. The sample is directly added to the mould.
3. Add filters from the apparatus menu to the top and bottom of the mould. Each of the filters has an attached pipe for inflow/outflow of liquid. Additionally, the top filter pipe has an attached stand pipe used for the measurement of change in the water head.
4. Add water from the apparatus menu to the top filter's stand pipe.
5. Add a filled tank from the apparatus menu. The mould is placed inside the tank. 
6. Add a container from the apparatus menu to collect the outgoing liquid (water). The container has markings to help determine the quantity of water collected.
7. Allow water to flow through the mould (and hence the soil) by clicking on the mould. Observe the change in the water head in the stand pipe.
8. Click the restart button to perform the experiment again.
